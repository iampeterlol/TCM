Sure, I'd be happy to provide you with a TCM consultation for the Red tongue with yellow, thick, greasy coating condition. Here's how you can format your output:

### TCM Diagnosis
- Bullet point 1 explaining the meaning of Red tongue with yellow, thick, greasy coating in TCM:
  - The tongue is red, with yellow, thick, greasy coating. This is due to an imbalance of the Yin and Yang forces, resulting in an accumulation of Qi, blood, and heat.
- Bullet point 2 describing possible internal imbalances or organ dysfunctions:
  - The condition can be caused by a deficiency in the Yin and Yang meridians or a blockage in the Qi or blood channels.
- Bullet point 3 listing common accompanying symptoms or patterns:
  - The condition may cause a burning sensation on the tongue, dryness or itching, and an unpleasant smell.

### Dietary Recommendations
- Bullet point 1 with specific foods or herbs to consume:
  - Foods that promote circulation, such as garlic and ginger, can help to remove the coating.
  - Herbs such as ginger, garlic, and red pepper can help to stimulate blood circulation and improve the body's ability to remove toxins.
- Bullet point 2 with foods or substances to avoid:
  - Foods that are high in fat or saturated fats, such as dairy products or processed meats, can contribute to the accumulation of Qi and blood.
  - Foods that are high in sugar, such as fried foods or sweetened beverages, can contribute to the accumulation of heat and cause an inflammatory response in the body.
- Bullet point 3 with any dietary habits or patterns to follow:
  - It's recommended to avoid eating fatty foods and sugar in the morning, and to drink plenty of water throughout the day to help flush out toxins.

### Lifestyle Guidance

  - Avoid sitting for long periods of time with your back straight and head tilted forward.
  - Practice yoga or other breathing exercises to help reduce stress and promote relaxation.
- Bullet point 2 on activities or environments to avoid:
  - Stressful or high-pressure situations, such as interviews or meetings.
  - Using electronics for prolonged periods, as they can emit radiation and emit heat from the screens.
