Sure, I'd be happy to provide a comprehensive TCM consultation for Red tongue with yellow, thick, greasy coating.

### TCM Diagnosis

- Based on the patient's history and physical examination, the TCM practitioner will diagnose Red tongue with yellow, thick, greasy coating as follows:
  - There is a potential for an imbalance of the "Yin" (the body's energy) and "Qi" (the body's vital energy) due to an accumulation of "Yin Qi" (irritation and blockage of the Liver Qi) and "Yang Qi" (inflammation and exacerbation of Liver Qi) in the mouth and tongue.
  - The coating is thick and greasy due to excess accumulation of "Yin Qi" and "Yang Qi" in the mouth and tongue.

### Dietary Recommendations

- To alleviate the symptoms of Red tongue with yellow, thick, greasy coating, the TCM practitioner will recommend the following dietary changes:
  - Avoid eating foods that are high in fat and spicy, as they can aggravate the "Yin Qi" and "Yang Qi" in the mouth and tongue.
  - Avoid foods that are high in oxidizing substances, such as red meat, tomatoes, and avocados, as they can further aggravate the "Yin Qi" and "Yang Qi" in the mouth and tongue.
  - Avoid foods that are high in cholesterol, such as saturated and trans fats, as they can further aggravate the "Yin Qi" and "Yang Qi" in the mouth and tongue.

### Lifestyle Guidance

- To promote overall health and well-being, the TCM practitioner will recommend the following lifestyle changes:
  - Avoid smoking, as it can further aggravate the "Yin Qi" and "Yang Qi" in the mouth and tongue.
  - Avoid excessive alcohol consumption, as it can further aggravate the "Yin Qi" and "Yang Qi" in the mouth and tongue.
  - Avoid stress and maintain a healthy sleep pattern, as these factors can further exacerbate the "Yin Qi" and "Yang Qi" in the mouth and tongue.

### Conclusion

The TCM practitioner will provide these dietary and lifestyle recommendations to help alleviate the symptoms of Red tongue with yellow, thick, greasy coating, and promote overall health and well-being.
