This can indicate a weakness in the digestive system and may be related to a variety of medical conditions, including stomach ulcers, gastritis, or gastric cancer.

- Listing common accompanying symptoms or patterns: Common accompanying symptoms of a yellow tongue may include fatigue, lack of appetite, bloating, and nausea. The tongue may also be thick and greasy, which can indicate an overactive or underactive immune system.

- Foods or substances to avoid: Avoid foods or substances that can aggravate this condition, such as spicy or acidic foods, alcohol, and processed or refined foods.

- Beneficial daily routines or habits: Avoid overeating, which can lead to a buildup of toxins in the body and exacerbate the symptoms of a yellow tongue. Practice regular exercise and a healthy diet, which can help support the body's Qi and reduce inflammation.

- Activities or environments to avoid: Avoid activities that can aggravate the condition, such as smoking, tanning, or heavy metal exposure. Avoid areas with high levels of pollution or stress, which can further weaken the immune system.
