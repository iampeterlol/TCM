Response: Thank you for the feedback. I would be happy to provide a more detailed TCM consultation for the Red tongue with yellow, thick, greasy coating condition. Here is the updated consultation:

### TCM Diagnosis
- The Red tongue with yellow, thick, greasy coating condition is caused by a combination of physical, emotional, and spiritual imbalances or deficiencies in the internal organs, meridians, and energy channels.
- The internal organs affected include the stomach, liver, and spleen, as well as the meridians located in the tongue, eyelids, and eyes.
- The emotional imbalances may be due to conflicts with family, friends, or significant others, which can manifest as anger, anxiety, or mistrust.
- The spiritual imbalances may arise from past traumas, addictions, or negative beliefs, which can manifest as insomnia, irritability, or depression.

### Dietary Recommendations
- Avoid eating foods high in sugar, fried foods, and processed and packaged foods, as they can stimulate the stomach and make the tongue coating thicker.
- Avoid overeating and consuming excessive amounts of fatty foods, as they can also stimulate the stomach and make the tongue coating thicker.
- Drink plenty of water to flush out toxins and promote digestion.

### Lifestyle Guidance
- Avoid eating foods that cause digestive distress, such as spicy or acidic foods, as they can cause irritation and inflammation in the stomach and make the tongue coating thicker.
- Practice gentle yoga, tai chi, or qigong to strengthen the body and calm the mind.
- Avoid overexerting oneself, as this can aggravate the condition and worsen the symptoms.

I hope this additional information helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
