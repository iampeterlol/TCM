As a TCM practitioner, I can provide a comprehensive TCM consultation on red tongue yellow fur thick greasy fur. Here are the steps I would follow:

1. TCM DIAGNOSIS:
- Explain that red tongue yellow fur thick greasy fur indicates a Yang Qi deficiency. The Yang Qi is responsible for maintaining the body's vital energy (Chi) and promoting physical health.
- Describe the underlying imbalances in Yang Qi:
  - The excess of cold and dryness in the liver and kidneys (which are responsible for regulating Yang Qi) leads to Yang Qi deficiency.
  - The excess of hot and dryness in the spleen and stomach (which are responsible for nourishing Yang Qi) leads to Yang Qi deficiency.

2. DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS:
- The first step in managing red tongue yellow fur thick greasy fur is to reduce the imbalances in Yang Qi. Therefore, it is recommended to adopt a diet that is rich in foods high in vitamins A, C, and E, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts. These foods are known to nourish and nurture the Yang Qi.
- Avoid foods that are rich in food dyes and preservatives, which can lead to an accumulation of toxins in the body.
- Include foods that are rich in B vitamins, such as soybeans, lentils, and leafy greens, in the diet. These foods are known to promote the growth and nourishment of the Yang Qi.
- Additionally, it is recommended to avoid foods that are high in sugar, processed foods, and alcohol, which can lead to an imbalance in the body's energy system.

3. LIFESTYLE GUIDANCE:
